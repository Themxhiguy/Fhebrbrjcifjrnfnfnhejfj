## Who is this package for

Package is for those who want a fully-configurable proxy that works on many sites

## Effectiveness of proxy

This proxy supports proxying
- basically everything except google logins

## Features of proxy

The proxy allows users to create a "session". When they access their session, their localStorage and cookies will be synced with rammerhead. This allows for accurately mocking cookied requests and conveniently save their logins even if they switch devices. This also enables users to configure a custom HTTP proxy server for rammerhead to connect to for the session.
